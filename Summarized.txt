  1. Introduction   Sorting algorithm is the proce ss of placing elements from a  collection in some kind of order. For example, a list of words  could be sorted alphabetically o r by length. A list of cities  could be sorted by population, by area, or by zip code[1] .  T h e  m o s t ‐ u s e d  o r d e r s  a r e  n u m e r i c a l  o r d e r  a n d   lexicographical order [2].  The sorting is a problem of central   importance  both  in  theoretical  and  practical computing  [3].Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms such  as search and merge algorithms  which require input data to be in sorted lists. Further, the  data is often taken to be in an array, which allows random  access,  rather  than  a  list,  which  only  allows  sequential  access. The sorting n algorithms can be applied with suitable modification  to  either  type  of  data.  Since  the  dawn  of  computing, the sorting problem has attracted a great deal of  research,  perhaps  due  to  the  complexity  of  solving  it  efficiently despite its simple, familiar statement. We have  already seen a number of algorithms that were able to sort u n s o r t e d  l i s t  b y  d i f f e r e n t  w a y s  a n d  s o l v e  t h e  s o r t i n g   problem. Computer sorting algorithms can be classified into  two  categories;  compariso n‐based  sorting  and  non‐ comparison‐based sorting. The purpose of this study is  making experimental comparison between three sorting algorithm Comb, Cocktail and Counting Sort to determine  experimentally which one is the fastest in term of execution  time. Three sorting algorithms are implemented using by java programming language, in which every algorithm sort  the same set of random numer ic data. Then the execution  time  during  the  sorting  process  is  measured  for  each  algorithm.  The rest part of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2  gives a background of the three algorithms; comb, count, and cocktail algorithms. In section 3, related work is presented.  Section4 comparison between the algorithms; section 5  discusses the results obtained from the evaluation of sorting  techniques considered. The pap er is concluded in section 6.   2. Background      2.1. Comb Sort  Comb sort is an enhanced version from bubble sort and  rediscovered by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box in 1991. [9].  Comb Sort is mainly an impro vement over Bubble Sort.  B u b b l e  s o r t  a l w a y s  c o m p a r e s  a d j a c e n t  v a l u e s

Cocktail Sort:  Cocktail sort is similar to the bubble sort in which both are  even and comparison‐based sorting algorithms as shown in  Figure 4. The Cocktail algorithm differs from a bubble sort in  that it sorts in both directions on each pass through the list as shown in Figure 3. This sorting algorithm is more difficult  to implement than the bubble sort [4]

Discussion     This section presents the discu ssion of results obtained from  evaluation of comb, cocktail, and count sort algorithms.  Cocktail have variation from  comb sort and count sort in  which it passes alternately from bottom to top and then from  top to bottom [8]. It can achieve slightly better performance  than count and comb sort. The reason for this is that  comb  and count  only passes through the list in one direction
